# Titanic Survival Prediction Machine Learning Project 🚢

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features such as age, sex, class, and other characteristics using machine learning models like Logistic Regression.

## Project Overview 📊

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features:
- Passenger Class 🏫
- Age 👶👵
- Sex 🚻
- Fare 💰
- Embarked Location 🌍

The objective is to train a machine learning model to predict survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Not Survived).

## Features 🛠️

- **Prediction Model**:
  - Logistic Regression 🔢
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. 📈
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for better model performance. ⚙️
- **Model Comparison**: Compared different machine learning models to determine the best one. 🏆
- **Visualization**: Visualized the distribution of passengers and the model performance using Matplotlib. 📊
